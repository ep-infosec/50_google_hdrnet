  (OpenGL convention).

  f is not smooth when:
  - |dx| is close to 0. We smooth this by replacing |dx| with
    SmoothedAbs(dx, eps) = sqrt(dx * dx + eps), which has derivative
    dx / sqrt(dx * dx + eps).
  - |dx| = 1. When smoothed, this happens when dx = sqrt(1 - eps). Like ReLU,
    We just ignore this (in the implementation below, when the floats are
    exactly equal, we choose the SmoothedAbsGrad path since it is more useful
    than returning a 0 gradient).

  Args:
    x: "Query" point position.
    xs: "Sample" position.
    eps: a small number.
